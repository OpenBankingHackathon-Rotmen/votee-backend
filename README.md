# Votee Hackathon project

Votee uses blockchain and the PSD2(Revised Directive on Payment Services) to leverage e-voting.
A user can login with his/her bacnk account to confirm identity before continuing to vote. If the bank confirms identity of a person, he/she is allowed to vote or else they have to find a different method(physical vote).

Smart contracts are used and hashes are created from user's vote, some private information over a salt that is regenerated everytime, ensuring it' security

The server only currently works in the the PSD2 sandbox environment provided by the organizers at the hackathon
